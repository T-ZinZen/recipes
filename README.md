# recipes
Goal of this project is to build a Website with a few recipes on it.
You will be able to switch the pages via relative links.
Finishing this project will demonstrate my ability to build a Website in html which 
contains headlines, paragraphs, (un-)ordered lists, images and links. 
There is also a .css style file added and linked to the .html file. In css I will add fonts, font colors, background colors and align elements. Moreover I will re-size images.
